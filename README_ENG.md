<b>
Sharp Stock Increase or Decrease (≥10%) – Signal to Buy or Sell?</b>

</div>

### Problem Description

- The goal of this study is to compare two strategies based on purchasing stocks at the **CLOSE price** on the day when a stock from the S&P 500 index experiences a **rise or fall of at least 10%**. The analysis covers **1-year, 3-year, and 5-year investment horizons**.  

- Using **S&P 500 data from 02.01.2005 to 02.01.2025**, a table was created showing each increase or decrease of at least 10% for a stock included in the S&P 500, along with the stock price **1 year, 3 years, and 5 years** after the observed rise or drop.  

- The study **excludes delisted companies**, as the data source is the Python library **yfinance**, which uses Yahoo Finance data. (Yahoo Finance does not provide free historical data for delisted stocks; access requires paid plans such as Yahoo Finance Gold.)  

- Only the period when the company was part of the S&P 500 was considered. For example, if a company was in the index for 7 years, only that period is included in the analysis.  

- In total, **14,177 cases** were recorded where an S&P 500 stock rose or fell by at least 10% in a single session. Due to some of these price changes occurring in the last year, last 3 years, or last 5 years of the studied period, the number of available observations for **1-year, 3-year, and 5-year returns** are **12,173, 9,489, and 5,985**, respectively.

### Summary

A strategy based on purchasing **undervalued but fundamentally strong stocks** proves to be **statistically more effective** than buying stocks “on the wave” of price surges. The chances of **above-average returns** are higher, while the risk of losses is **comparable or lower**, especially over shorter horizons. (Investors should still be cautious of “falling knives,” which is discussed elsewhere.)  

The analysis can also inform **selling decisions** – if portfolio stocks drop **10% or more** but the company’s fundamentals remain solid, it may be worth **increasing the holding**. Avoiding FOMO when other stocks rise, and **consistently sticking to investment principles**, generally leads to better long-term results.  

However, this does **not mean sharp increases should be ignored** – if a rapid surge is backed by **strong long-term fundamentals**, a purchase may be justified. In such cases, it is recommended to analyze potential **opportunity costs** and adjust the **portfolio structure** if necessary.
